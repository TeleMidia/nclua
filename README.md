![NCLua](contrib/nclua.png)

The NCLua library adds event handling and 2D graphics to Lua scripts.
Programs written in C can use libnclua to run embedded NCLua scripts, i.e.,
Lua scripts that use the APIs exported by libnclua; Lua scripts can also use
libnclua, either through the C API or by requiring the appropriated modules
-- e.g., `canvas` for 2D graphics, `event` for general event handling,
`event.stopwatch` for stopwatch timers, `event.tcp_socket` for asynchronous
TCP sockets, `event.http_soup` for asynchronous HTTP requests, etc.  The
NCLua library comes with a standalone interpreter, called `nclua`
(cf. [src/nclua.c](src/nclua.c)), which can be used to run NCLua scripts.

For stable releases and binaries, cf.
http://www.telemidia.puc-rio.br/~gflima/nclua.

For the latest sources, cf.
https://github.com/telemidia/nclua.

NCLua is the Lua dialect used by the Brazilian digital TV middleware, called
Ginga (cf. http://www.ginga.org.br).  The reference implementation of
Ginga (>= 0.14) uses libnclua to run NCLua scripts.

Building the repository
------------

### Dependencies

Required:
* Lua >= 5.2, http://www.lua.org
* Cairo >= 1.10, http://cairographics.org
* GLib >= 2.32, https://developer.gnome.org/glib
* Pango >= 1.30, http://www.pango.org

Optional:
* GIO >= 2.32, https://developer.gnome.org/gio
* Libsoup >= 2.42, https://developer.gnome.org/libsoup
* GTK+ >= 3.4.2, http://www.gtk.org

GIO is used by the `tcp` event class, Libsoup is used by the `http` event
class, and GTK+ is used by the `nclua` binary.  These libraries are
optional, if they are not present the corresponding modules are not built.

### Linux

On Ubuntu-based distros, to install the dependencies run:

    $ sudo apt-get install -y git gcc g++ autotools-dev dh-autoreconf \
        liblua5.2-dev libglib2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev \
        librsvg2-dev libgtk-3-dev libsoup2.4-dev -qq

To build with autotools run:

    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/
    $ make
